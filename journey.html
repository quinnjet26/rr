<h2>
<b>Journey of the Recognition Roundtable</h2><br>
<p>Written by Donna Gray, founding member, for our 25th year celebration in 2024</b></p>
<p>
The birth of the Recognition Roundtable dates back 25 years to February 1999 at the then ARA Las Vegas industry trade show, at the MGM Grand Hotel, when visionaries Steve and Nora Capper invited 6 other awards retailers to a meeting in their hotel room.  The purpose of the get together was to explore the idea of forming a mastermind group, a kind of industry brain trust that would act as mentors to each other’s businesses.   Present, besides the Cappers, were Dave and Donna Gray, Brian Martin, Cheryl and George Cowart, Chuck Loviesky, Craig Bailey and Don Bellarby.
These 7 industry leader stores were the core for what has now grown to 26 current member stores representing industry businesses from all over North America.
2001 brought new members, Pat and Pam Holley, and Mike and Claudia Montecalvo.  Gordon and Sherry Grabill were added in 2002 and in 2003 the group welcomed Floyd and Mary Lee Hershberger, Rick and Gini DeWolf and Rick Woltman.
Kevin and Kami Arnold, Richard and Ed Korbyl, Jeff and Joy Giffing all became members in 2007, and in 2009, Gino Zavarella Sr and Gino Jr, and Peter and Colette Clarke joined the group.  2014 saw the addition of Mark and Kim Case.  And, the group continued to grow in 2016 with Bruce and Darlene Anderson, Sue Brown, Wilson and Kathy Brim becoming members.
Again more growth in 2019 with the addition of  Kathy Gralike, Joseph Sant,  Jay and Becci Nagle, Terry and Anne Dering, Brian and Lori Genrich and Lori and Scott Strobl, Tim and Cindy Hoffman, and Josh and Stacey Perelman.  And, 2023 welcomed our newest members Lisa and Jeff Higginbotham.
Here we are now, celebrating 25 years of dedication to our craft and to our industry, along with our vendor partners, whom we thank for the help and support they have provided as our group has continued to grow and prosper.
From the beginning the Recognition Roundtable members have shared not only our business lives but our personal lives.  We’ve had wonderful times visiting the cities and businesses of our members, as well as our vendors.  We have celebrated 50th wedding anniversaries, graduations, marriages and successes of our children, births of our grandchildren and even great grandchildren.  We’ve prayed for each other during illnesses and on sad occasions, we’ve celebrated a life well lived when we’ve had to say good-bye to a beloved member or vendor.  So for all of this, we are thankful to Steve and Nora for their vision, and for letting us join them on this journey.

And just like that it’s been 25 years!

The Recognition Roundtable has continued to grow with the addition of Dennis & Linda Dwyer and Purav & Charu Patel in 2025.</p>
